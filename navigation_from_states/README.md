# Project 1 - Navigation
This project is part of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree and most of the files are based on assignments and environments that are part of the class.

# Project Details
The goal of the project is to create an agent that learns to navigate a 2d environment (provided by Unity) in a manner that maximizes the total reward generated. Rewards are +1 if a yellow banana is collected and -1 if a blue banana is collected. An agent can move forward, backward or turn right or left. Once an agent takes an action, the unity environment provides a reward and new state. The state contains the agent's velocity and perception of objects (not pixel information). The environment runs for 300 frames before a new episode starts. An environment is considered solved if the score for an episode (300 frames) is >=13.

# Getting Started:
Note: I have not tested this locally.

From the python directory run 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Instructions for training an agent
Open Navigation.ipynb and run the cells
